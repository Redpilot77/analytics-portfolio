# Airline Delay & Cost Impact Analysis (Excel)

## Overview
This project analyzes U.S. airline delay data to identify operational delay patterns and estimate the potential cost impact of delays.

The analysis is designed to reflect how airline operations, finance, and analytics teams evaluate delay drivers and prioritize improvement efforts.

## Business Questions
- Which delay types occur most frequently?
- Which airlines experience the highest average delays?
- Which airports contribute the most delay minutes?
- What is the estimated operational cost impact of delays?

## Dataset
Public U.S. airline on-time performance data containing:
- Carrier
- Origin airport
- Delay type and duration
- Flight counts

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preparation in Excel
- Pivot tables for aggregation and comparison
- KPI calculations (average delay, total delay minutes)
- Estimated cost impact using delay-minute assumptions
- Visual summaries for executive review

## Key Metrics
- Total delay minutes by airline
- Average delay per flight
- Delay composition by cause
- Estimated cost impact of delays

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Charts and KPI summaries

## Outcome
The project demonstrates how Excel can be used to translate raw operational data into decision-ready insights for airline operations and finance teams.
